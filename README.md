Product's description:
  Dealing with Generation Z, older teachers tend to struggle to deliver materials as it is difficult to keep the Gen Z students interested. In terms of knowledge, Boomer teachers, which made up 71% of Indonesia’s active teachers, with no doubt wins the race, however, keeping students interested is just as important. Asgur.id connects teachers with not just fellow teachers, but with youth force of talents to collaborate, fill each other’s weaknesses and make education better for the generation.
  Our product, Asgur.id, has 3 key features, Cari asisten, buat soal, and last but not least, our MVP, bantuan materi. Cari Asisten or Co-Work is a channel for high school freelance to adorn teachers' learning material. Our Co-Create feature called "Buat Soal" is to help teachers make question sheet that may look simple, but takes a whole lot time. And lastly, Bantuan Materi, a Co-Material feature to connect teachers through sharing materials, resources and teaching methods.

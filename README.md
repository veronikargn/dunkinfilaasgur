Product's description:
  Our product, Asgur.id, has 3 key features, Cari asisten, buat soal, and last but not least, our MVP, bantuan materi. Cari Asisten or Co-Work is a channel for high school freelance to adorn teachers' learning material, connecting teachers with youth force of talents to collaborate. Our Co-Create feature called "Buat Soal" is to help teachers save time in making question sheet that may look simple, but takes a whole lot time. And lastly, Bantuan Materi, a Co-Material feature to connect teachers with fellow teachers through sharing teaching materials, resources and teaching methods.
